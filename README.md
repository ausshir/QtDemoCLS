<h2>Demo Qt App for CLS Job Application</h2>


Progess: Done! I think... :)

To Do: Generate a makefile for release and test for any irregularities on Linux


To build, install Qt5.5 and make sure all paths are correct.
Then do:

    qmake
    mingw32-make
	
And run the program in the release folder.

An excecutatble is included under releases but probably does not work outside of my environment.
*Note this has only been tested on Windows 10 with dynamic libraries and has not yet been tested on any other OS*
